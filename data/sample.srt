1
00:00:01,088 --> 00:00:04,004
- Hello?
- Bonsoir, Elliot.

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,657
They're planning something.

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:08,225
17 of 71 facilities
around the country so far.

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,662
This is where
the paper records are going.

5
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:12,751
Elliot, what is Stage 2?

6
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,624
The femtocell was to
get access to their UPS's.

7
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:18,322
They're trying to blow up
Evil Corp's recovery building.

8
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,890
I don't play fair.
I play what I want.

9
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,761
We need to
look into our stage two schedule.

10
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:25,329
- I invoke my Fifth Amendment...
- You're an enemy combatant.

11
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,114
You don't have any rights.

12
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:28,637
One of your patients
hacked me.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,421
He stole my dog
on top of it.

14
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:31,553
Tyrell, is that you?

15
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:32,945
The phone call...
make me understand.

16
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:35,644
I wanted you
to feel what I felt.

17
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:38,212
- You pussy.
- You...

18
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:39,865
This fucker thinks
he can hurt my girl!

19
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,041
If you're serious about

20
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,303
punishing him...
I am.

21
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:43,739
Just tell me what to do.
The E Corp party.

22
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:45,132
When you saw Scott,
he was disheveled.

23
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,438
- Yeah, but Joanna...
- Tell the cops your story.

24
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:50,659
Scott Knowles intimidated you.
This is how we punish him.

25
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:51,964
That ever-looming presence

26
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,445
that is Mr. Robot,
I don't feel it.

27
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,883
Is it possible that
the bullet killed him...

28
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,059
And not me?

29
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:00,408
I need to find a way
to fix what I did.

30
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,758
I need a job at Evil Corp.

31
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,901
You know when
you fuck something up

32
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:18,034
and you wish you had
the power to hit "undo"?

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,648
Like when you say
the dumbest thing

34
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:25,694
in front of
your biggest crush.

35
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:30,829
Or when you talk shit
about your boss in an email,

36
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:33,267
then hit "reply all"
to everyone at work.

37
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,531
Or when you crash
the entire world economy

38
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:38,794
and kick-start
the inevitable downfall

39
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:40,970
of human civilization?

40
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,104
We all have those days.

41
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,891
But today is not
gonna be one of them.

42
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:55,637
Because today

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,726
I found a way to hit "undo".

44
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:03,862
Today is the day
I start working at Evil Corp.

45
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,735
Hello.
I'm Linda,

46
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,172
Chief Human Resources Officer
here at Evil Corp.

47
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:12,175
Evil Corp is, well, evil.

48
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,873
That much I thought,
but what I didn't realize was

49
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,658
maybe they're a necessary evil

50
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,747
that just needs to be
kept in check.

51
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,879
In fact,
maybe calling them evil

52
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:24,013
was just my dorm room
philosophizing run amuck.

53
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:26,798
I'd like to say welcome
to the Evil Corp family.

54
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,278
We're happy to have you here.

55
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:30,193
But this doesn't mean
I'm selling out.

56
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:32,064
I'm just growing up.

57
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,892
Signing up for a 401K,

58
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:36,721
choosing an HMO plan
with a good deductible.

59
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:38,070
Sign up for Trunk Club.

60
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,727
Pop a few Zoloft.

61
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,078
Join in on
the live-action cartoon

62
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,907
of 2D emotions
that everyone else is in.

63
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,172
I finally see the fatal
exception error of my ways,

64
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,956
and I know what to do now.

65
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,914
I'm gonna fix
the world I broke,

66
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,352
and put it back together
better than it was before.

67
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:01,311
Let's talk about your crucial
role here at Evil Corp.

68
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:03,922
I'm gonna undo the hack.

69
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,664
Now, I can't decrypt
the data I fucked up,

70
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,362
that much is true.

71
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,102
But since I'm working
on the recovery team,

72
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,887
I can help them
rebuild the database

73
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,889
and defend the fort
at the same time.

74
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:17,109
There's a little talent
roaming around on this floor,

75
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:19,982
but the primo poon
is on floor 31.

76
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:22,289
As of last week, it
looks like Tyrell was right.

77
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:24,769
Evil Corp has delivered
their paper records

78
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:28,947
from 17 of their 71 buildings
to their New York facility.

79
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:31,907
Pretty sure she would cheat
on her fiancé for me, man.

80
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,258
She really... like, the way she
looks at me, dude, it's like,

81
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,173
slippery when wet, am I right?

82
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,045
But lucky for them,
now they've got me.

83
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,013
Our current plan
is deeply flawed

84
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:52,014
and massively inefficient.

85
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,276
This is William.

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,235
He's my technology manager.

87
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,802
If I can convince him
to convince his boss

88
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:00,022
to convince his boss
to convince her boss

89
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,893
to digitize all
the paper records

90
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,417
in their local facilities

91
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,767
instead of shipping them here,
then...

92
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,073
We can avoid
a single point of failure.

93
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:09,466
We would install
hardware and softw...

94
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,294
Elliot,
I hear your passion,

95
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,296
but I got tickets to the
Goo Goo Dolls reunion concert

96
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,298
- tonight, so let's wrap this up.
- Okay?

97
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:20,042
His password was pretty easy
to figure out after that.

98
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,262
After going through
his emails,

99
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,220
I quickly learned that
he was having the engineers

100
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,310
install rootkits on
all of Evil Corp's phones,

101
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:30,313
so they can illegally sell
private consumer data.

102
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,796
I tipped off the FBI,

103
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,320
got him arrested,
and promptly set a meeting

104
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,322
with the next exec
up the chain.

105
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,334
But meetings can take
forever to set.

106
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:54,119
So in the meantime,
I had to look for a stopgap.

107
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:55,991
In this case, E Shipping,

108
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:00,952
Wait a minute,
this ain't right.

109
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:03,259
All our shipments
are supposed to go to New York.

110
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,828
The paper says
"Sioux Falls, South Dakota."

111
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:09,831
Yeah, you're in Sioux Falls,
Earl,

112
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:13,051
which sure as shit
don't make no sense.

113
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:16,228
But all right.
Unpack her, boys!

114
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:18,056
I'm sending shipping
requests

115
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,884
to the actual facilities,

116
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:22,017
but in the manifest,
I'm making it look like

117
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,062
all the paper's still
arriving in New York.

118
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,369
It'll take a while, but
I just need to buy enough time

119
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:29,111
until I can prove my case
to upper management.

120
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:39,382
By eliminating
physical paper delivery,

121
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,166
we can cut E Shipping cost,

122
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,299
installing hardware
and software at...

123
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,215
Elliot, you are ambitious,
I'll give you that,

124
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:49,087
but I got a SoulCycle class
I'm late for.

125
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:52,352
Let's pick this up
sometime next quarter?

126
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,225
Hacking Peter
was as easy as watching him.

127
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,881
I felt bad taking him down,

128
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:02,231
until I saw that
he had his engineering team

129
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,276
use special software
to help E Corp's

130
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,845
auto manufacturing partners
cheat the emissions test

131
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,413
to hide how much pollution
they really created.

132
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:15,418
Factoring in the bureaucracy
and the line of

133
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:18,247
corrupt, moronic managers
I have to get through,

134
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,901
I'll need to keep up
the illusion that

135
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,468
shipments are still happening.

136
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:24,427
These are the same damn boxes
you brought last week.

137
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,822
You know me.
I do what the paper says.

138
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,085
All right!

139
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,565
Pack it up, boys!

140
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,305
Problem with my illusion is,

141
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,133
what if Tyrell
and the Dark Army

142
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,092
think all the records
actually get there?

143
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:40,138
This is why I gotta keep
the UPS systems safe too,

144
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,532
because these innocuous
backup batteries

145
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,404
in the New York facility

146
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,232
can turn into idle bombs
with the right malware.

147
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,191
And these are
the frontline soldiers

148
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,149
trusted to protect them.

149
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,369
You guys gonna stop me?
Uh, I'm a bloodhound, girl.

150
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,327
I just dove right back in,
dude, just... ah.

151
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,330
This patch ensures
that the UPS devices

152
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:00,071
will only run trusted code

153
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:02,509
that's digitally signed
by Evil Corp.

154
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,467
Bottom line:
even if they think

155
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,338
all the paper records
got here,

156
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,471
they won't be able
to blow up that building.

157
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:20,265
In conclusion,
digitizing locally

158
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,572
and not shipping
paper records here

159
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:25,575
is the best option
for our recovery efforts.

160
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,502
Perfect.

161
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:42,157
Let's set a meeting
with the VP of Technology.

162
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,202
I want to get this
in front of him.

163
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:47,205
Great work, Elliot.

164
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,084
Once upper management's
on board,

165
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,390
we'll be on our way
to rebuilding the database

166
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:01,219
and the hack will
officially be behind us.

167
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:03,918
Doesn't mean that
in my spare time I can't

168
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:07,095
find ways to purge Evil Corp
of all their shitbags.

169
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:10,228
You know, your typical
subprime mortgage scammers,

170
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,403
Ponzi schemers...

171
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,709
Pension embezzlers,

172
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:14,537
and sexual harassers.

173
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,670
That way, when Evil Corp
gets back on its feet,

174
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,062
they'll no longer be evil.

175
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:19,411
We're proud to call you

176
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,239
a new member of Evil... E Corp.

177
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,937
Because changing the world

178
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,504
was never about
tearing E Corp down.

179
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,462
It's about making them better.

180
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,944
Maybe I fucked up
an already fucked-up world,

181
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,337
but I'm fixing it now,
hitting "undo."

182
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,296
And, friend, it feels great.

183
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:15,598
Okay, if I'm being real,

184
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:18,470
I haven't fixed everything.

185
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:30,134
The loneliness came back.

186
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:33,137
Worse than I remember.

187
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,148
I don't get it.

188
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,629
I know I'm doing
the right thing.

189
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:47,761
You have to see that.

190
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:52,200
Then what is this?

191
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:54,768
Why do I feel
this empty void inside?

192
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,600
Even the Zoloft isn't helping.

193
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:05,343
I don't know what to do.

194
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,610
Fuck.

195
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,394
What's wrong with me?

196
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:15,658
I'm really
starting to lose it.

197
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:21,533
With everything going on,
my landlord at the office

198
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:24,798
hasn't been paying
utilities or maintenance, so...

199
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:29,063
I'll be working from
my home office for a while.

200
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,721
Am I supposed
to say something?

201
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,682
It's a nice rug.

202
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,684
Thank you.

203
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,688
How are you feeling
about your birthday today?

204
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,822
Shit.

205
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,519
She's right.

206
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:52,347
Totally forgot.

207
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,089
It is my birthday today.

208
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,570
Do you have plans tonight?

209
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,315
Uh... no.

210
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,408
In our last session,

211
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:14,108
we talked about your sister.

212
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:16,110
We haven't been talking.

213
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,721
Can I ask why?

214
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:23,334
She's one of the reasons
he comes out.

215
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:25,249
Talk about that.

216
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:28,513
Well, he's...
been gone, right?

217
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,734
He hasn't come out since
I stopped talking to her.

218
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:34,737
How does that make you feel,

219
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:38,262
that he's not around anymore?

220
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:41,788
It's different.

221
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,529
It's better.
For everyone.

222
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,706
You're still not
answering the question.

223
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,577
How do you feel?

224
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,367
Good.

225
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:00,458
You miss him, don't you?

226
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,506
It's okay if you do.

227
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,511
I miss being
a part of something.

228
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:12,732
Being a part of what,
exactly?

229
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,867
Something important.

230
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:21,175
That meant something.

231
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:39,497
Where'd you go?

232
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:49,203
I remembered this time
Darlene and I...

233
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,945
Never mind.

234
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,816
I'd love to hear it,

235
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,688
if you don't mind sharing it.

236
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,786
When we were kids,

237
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:10,267
this one year, there was
this huge snowstorm.

238
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,792
And Darlene and I
were so excited.

239
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:16,839
And we spent all day
just playing outside.

240
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:20,843
We made this snowman,
and we called him...

241
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,368
Kevin McAllister,

242
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:27,545
you know,
the kid from "Home Alone."

243
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,810
We were pretty obsessed
with that movie.

244
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,724
We even did
the hands to the face,

245
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,857
like how he does in the movie.

246
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,598
And how'd that turn out?

247
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:40,732
He just looked like a snowman

248
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:45,520
with no arms
and weird cheeks.

249
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,395
And we were so proud of it,
we promised

250
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,311
we'd steal my dad's camera and

251
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,879
take a picture of it
before it melted.

252
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:01,405
And what happened
when you went back out?

253
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,581
I never got a chance to.

254
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,583
Why not?

255
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,759
That was the day
of my accident,

256
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,892
when my dad pushed me
out the window.

257
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:13,330
We were at the hospital
till pretty late.

258
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,642
Your dad pushed you
out a window?

259
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,992
Yeah.

260
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,776
I've told you that before.

261
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,344
Elliot, you've never...

262
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,781
No, you've never told me this.

263
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:30,782
That's weird.

264
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,828
I remember...

265
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,616
I could have sworn
I told you.

266
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:43,099
There's not much to it.

267
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,101
He pushed me out the window.

268
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:47,930
I broke my arm
and went to the hospital.

269
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,714
Kevin melted.

270
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:52,935
Darlene was pissed.

271
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:55,111
End of story.

272
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:00,943
What made you think of this
just now?

273
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,839
I don't know.

274
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:32,061
Truth bombs are coming
your way, Cody-ites.

275
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:34,455
Tonight, please welcome
our special guest,

276
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:37,501
Joanna Wellick.
Thanks for being here.

277
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:38,981
Thank you for having me.

278
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,027
Scott Knowles has, uh,
been facing charges

279
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,638
for murdering his wife,
Sharon Knowles.

280
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,770
Initially, your husband,
Tyrell Wellick,

281
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,642
was accused of the murder,

282
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,122
until you claimed Scott Knowles

283
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:52,429
confessed to killing his wife
while beating you.

284
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,910
And since then, a bartender
from the night of the party

285
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,869
has also come forward
to corroborate your story.

286
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,654
I know that this must
be difficult for you.

287
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,917
You've been brave
just coming here.

288
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,875
Do you want to tell us a little
more about what happened?

289
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,574
My lawyers have advised me
not to speak to that.

290
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:10,534
But what I can say, Frank,
is that

291
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:13,842
I didn't need Scott Knowles
to be arrested to know

292
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:15,887
that my husband is innocent.

293
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:18,542
Mr. Knowles is...

294
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,718
clearly a troubled man

295
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:25,071
and has been fixating on us
for some time.

296
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,595
I understand that
you and your son

297
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:31,033
have been tormented endlessly
by fanatics and paparazzi.

298
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:34,036
Some even went so far as to
claim you filed for divorce.

299
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,171
I did file for divorce...
a few months ago.

300
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,738
It was a moment of weakness.

301
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,524
I listened to the wrong people,

302
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:47,745
who were convincing me that
that was the right thing to do.

303
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,922
But I have and

304
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:53,186
always will be faithful

305
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:56,058
to Tyrell.

306
00:16:56,102 --> 00:17:00,932
I have since dismissed
my petition for divorce.

307
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:04,458
He is...

308
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:07,069
the only man I've ever loved

309
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,071
and the only man

310
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:11,465
I ever will love.

311
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:14,903
In times of
chaos and uncertainty,

312
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:17,036
when the world
feels off balance,

313
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,516
we look to those who've stood
with us from the beginning.

314
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,172
Since 1884,
we've had America's back.

315
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:26,001
We may get knocked down, but
we'll never be knocked out.

316
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,786
Still on your side.

317
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,962
Breaking news:
a new fsociety video

318
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:33,095
has been released.

319
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,749
Hello, E Corp.

320
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,881
We are fsociety.

321
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:38,796
We are here to tell you that

322
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,886
though you survived
our first blow,

323
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,976
you will not survive our last.

324
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,718
In the coming weeks,
we will be sending you

325
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:49,590
a message so loud

326
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,723
that it will make
your eardrums explode...

327
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:53,724
literally.

328
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:57,119
The clock is ticking.

329
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:59,643
We are fsociety.

330
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,124
We are malicious and hostile.

331
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,126
We do not compromise.

332
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,563
You have been warned.

333
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:14,832
It was released
about an hour ago.

334
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:17,226
Six weeks,
you've given us nothing.

335
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,055
And now we have
this to deal with?

336
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,839
That video is bullshit.

337
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:24,059
That video came from
the same Vimeo account

338
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,323
as the last one you guys used.

339
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:30,239
Then it has to be Dark Army.

340
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:34,025
Cisco probably
gave them access.

341
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,592
But that is not
one of our guys,

342
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:36,680
okay, trust me on this...

343
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,552
You're a CHS.

344
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,641
You understand what
that means, right?

345
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,860
I don't understand half the
letters you guys throw at me.

346
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,689
Confidential human source.

347
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,865
Cool.
Now I get it.

348
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,172
See what speaking English
can accomplish?

349
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,871
Your job is to get intel
from Elliot on Tyrell Wellick.

350
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:56,352
That is the only reason
you're not in jail right now.

351
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:58,224
I don't know what
you want me to tell you, dude.

352
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,226
He's not talking to Tyrell.

353
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:02,358
How do you know that?

354
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,932
Five weeks ago,
the night we lost your tail...

355
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,195
And then gave us
a bullshit explanation as to

356
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,241
where you went?
Yeah.

357
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,199
Stink on that
still hasn't washed off.

358
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:21,247
I asked Elliot point-blank,
and he said no.

359
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,772
If you don't believe me,

360
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,643
bring him in.
He'll tell you the same thing.

361
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,254
You know that telling Elliot
anything about this

362
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,821
would violate
the terms of your immunity.

363
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:32,867
It would spook
his connection to Tyrell.

364
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,217
Get woke already, dude.

365
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,915
He is not nor has he ever

366
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,136
had a fucking relationship
with Tyrell.

367
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,993
June 16, 2015.

368
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,952
This is a call from Queensboro
Correctional Facility.

369
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:19,783
Hello?

370
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:22,090
Is it really you?

371
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:25,920
Who is this?

372
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,969
Bonsoir, Elliot.

373
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:36,322
You're listening
to '80s XM radio.

374
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:49,291
You've been looking in the
mirror the whole drive home.

375
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,946
I need to make a stop.

376
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,353
Stay here.

377
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:26,328
You want to consider
your actions carefully.

378
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:30,201
She fucking lied to me.

379
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,943
She went on national television

380
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:36,033
and she said
she still loves him.

381
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:39,820
You love me!

382
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,822
I know you do!

383
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:45,042
You told me
we were gonna be together.

384
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:48,524
That's the only reason
I agreed to testify!

385
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:51,832
You made me lie to the police
to get Tyrell off!

386
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,486
But now I'm gonna
tell them the truth!

387
00:21:57,794 --> 00:22:00,014
Get up.

388
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:06,150
If you retract
your statement, you will die.

389
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:09,066
I'm not being
overly emotional about this.

390
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,243
It's just that's how little
we care about your life.

391
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,116
Forget this night
ever happened, move on.

392
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,336
Marry a nice, young lady

393
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,381
who actually finds
whatever you are charming.

394
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,340
But understand one thing:

395
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,386
as certain as the pain
you're feeling right now,

396
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,258
there is no option
where you and Joanna ever

397
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:29,086
see each other again.

398
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:52,022
Is everything under control?

399
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,242
Yes, ma'am.

400
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,418
He just needed
a little clarity.

401
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:11,477
No, no, no, no, no.

402
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,640
The shooter didn't survive.

403
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,511
The driver looks like
he's gonna pull through.

404
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,121
We have someone
down at the hospital,

405
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:32,471
ready to question,
but he's still in ICU.

406
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,081
This information
is too sensitive

407
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:35,430
to share with the public.

408
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,953
We got lucky
we were on the scene

409
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:39,216
before anyone saw the body.

410
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,479
What about the baby?

411
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,697
Once you contact
the next of kin...

412
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,394
We're not contacting them.

413
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:47,311
He's going to social services.

414
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:50,967
Don't be soft.
Not now.

415
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,927
Her husband is the most
wanted man in the world.

416
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,537
And you and I both know
that finding him is

417
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,408
more important than
anything else, especially

418
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,020
with that goddamn video
that just got released.

419
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:05,547
Something about that video.

420
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:08,289
I believe Darlene
when she says it's not real.

421
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:11,205
We have to assume fsociety's
grown past her at this point.

422
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:14,121
Yeah, but why wouldn't
she just say that then?

423
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:16,558
Her whole immunity's
based on giving us intel.

424
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:19,126
Right now all she wants to do
is protect her brother,

425
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,476
who took a job at E Corp
for Lord knows why.

426
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,347
There's no incentive
for her to lie to us.

427
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,611
She didn't even know
he was working with Tyrell.

428
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,569
Why would you trust her
on this?

429
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:32,574
Because I still think there's
a Dark Army connection here.

430
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:35,708
We have our other team
looking into them.

431
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:39,189
Your focus needs to stay
on Tyrell and fsociety.

432
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:46,414
Guys back at CART are zeroing
in on the guy in the video.

433
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:49,460
We might have a good lead soon.

434
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:52,159
Let's just hope you're
reading your girl right.

435
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:54,596
I'm worried
she's a flight risk.

436
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:59,383
No, she's good.

437
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:01,298
Trust me.

438
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,707
I'm surprised you came.

439
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,491
Thought you were
going the distance

440
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:21,797
with the silent treatment.

441
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,538
If I remember correctly,

442
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,586
you were the one who
told me to go fuck myself.

443
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,590
Since when did you start
remembering everything so well?

444
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:40,555
Why'd you text me, Darlene?
What am I doing here?

445
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,602
Wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.

446
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,518
Is that all?

447
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:50,217
God, what is your problem?

448
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,176
Why are you trying
to shut me out?

449
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,049
- Because we can't talk.
- Why not?

450
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:58,225
You know why.

451
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:00,662
Maybe I want to
hear you say it.

452
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,622
Because...

453
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:06,276
you're my trigger.

454
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,496
What am I,
in a fucking therapy session?

455
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,193
Makes sense.

456
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:13,066
You're my sister,
part of my childhood.

457
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:16,417
If I could take back
what happened to Dad, I would.

458
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,681
What happened to him
fucked me up too.

459
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,378
So don't think for a second

460
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:24,207
our shitty childhood
is only yours.

461
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:33,695
I wish Dad were here right now.

462
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:36,742
He'd know what to do.

463
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:43,313
I'm leaving.

464
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:44,663
First thing in the morning,

465
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,317
I'm gonna crash with
a friend upstate.

466
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:50,712
I can't do this anymore.

467
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:53,759
I can't be here.

468
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:58,502
Just thought
you'd want to know that.

469
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,291
Spending this last year
with you was never about

470
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:07,381
whatever the fuck
you want to call what we did.

471
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,514
The real reason
I did all of this

472
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,692
was so that
we could be close again.

473
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,737
I guess that's...

474
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:19,436
something else
I thought you'd want to know.

475
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:29,925
You remember when
we made Kevin McAllister,

476
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:32,536
the snowman?

477
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,803
Of course.

478
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:45,201
Do you... do you
want to talk about it?

479
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,344
I want you
to stay with me tonight.

480
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:59,259
I'm good, dude, you don't
have to worry about me.

481
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:00,564
It's not that.

482
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:08,964
I don't want to be alone.

483
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:21,803
Given the ripple effect
of rapid global inflation,

484
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:25,807
19 of the 20 members
of this international forum

485
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:29,289
have signed
the Five/Nine Economic Accord,

486
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:31,900
making Ecoin the currency

487
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:34,294
by which all others
will be measured.

488
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:35,861
The only obstacle

489
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:39,342
is the illegitimate
monetary imposter

490
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:43,346
that China has
unofficially adopted...

491
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:45,740
Bitcoin.

492
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:50,571
China is weakening
our economic state

493
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,355
by not signing this accord,

494
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,489
and the fact
that they have embraced Bitcoin

495
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,708
shows their resistance

496
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,754
and emphatic rejection

497
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,887
of our collective attempt

498
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,715
to rescue the global economy.

499
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,717
In short,

500
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,850
ladies and gentlemen...

501
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,856
They are declaring
a currency war.

502
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,563
This has to be brief.

503
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:29,262
Truthfully, the only reason
I even agreed to meet

504
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:30,959
was that this room
happens to be on my way out...

505
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:34,397
Have your government
sign the goddamn accord!

506
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:39,881
In 11 days,
you'll have what you want.

507
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:42,710
U.N. vote to annex the Congo,
it's as good as yours,

508
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:45,974
but this currency war
must end.

509
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:54,417
The rest of the world needs
China to embrace Ecoin now.

510
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:58,291
We're at risk of
other countries pulling out.

511
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:05,080
Let me put this
as simply as I can,

512
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:08,997
so that we never have to
belabor this point again.

513
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:14,002
Your success will always
follow mine.

514
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,485
I don't give a fuck
about your accord.

515
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,922
Until I get my U.N. vote,

516
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,620
don't waste my time.

517
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:25,622
Or maybe in 11 days,

518
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:28,451
the administration
changes its mind

519
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:31,106
about your precious U.N. vote

520
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,633
I worked so hard
to procure for you.

521
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,912
Your empty threat reminds me

522
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:57,524
that there's something
I never shared with you.

523
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:00,353
My associates found
your pet employee

524
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:01,920
after she smuggled out
documents on

525
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:04,400
the Washington Township plant.

526
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:07,795
Now that I've gotten
a chance to talk to her,

527
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:09,884
I can see why you like her.

528
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,975
She makes
a very good companion.

529
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,846
And those eyes of hers...

530
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,632
I contemplated firing a bullet
into each of them,

531
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:23,724
but they're just
so hypnotizing.

532
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,037
Don't mistake my generosity

533
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,692
for generosity.

534
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,053
What are you doing?

535
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:34,490
Why are you awake?
It's early.

536
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:37,667
You're not
answering my question.

537
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:40,583
What were you doing
by my computer?

538
00:33:40,627 --> 00:33:43,499
I saw you behind the monitor.

539
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:46,241
Jesus,
I was looking for a pen.

540
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:47,721
To write you a note.

541
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:49,157
What's with
the fucking paranoia?

542
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:50,985
A note for what?

543
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,074
I'm leaving.
I have to catch my bus.

544
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,989
The buses aren't running.

545
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,558
There's a transportation
strike, it's all over the news.

546
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,994
Okay, the train then.

547
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,475
What's with the interrogation?

548
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:04,912
You were gonna leave
without saying good-bye.

549
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:07,262
Thus, the note.

550
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,177
And here I thought
we were in a good fucking place

551
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,787
after last night.

552
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:14,965
You're not answering
my fucking question.

553
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,619
Why are you here?

554
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:20,101
What do you mean?
You invited me.

555
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,755
Jesus.

556
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:23,017
It's you.

557
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,671
What'd you do
with the computer?

558
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:26,107
Why did you
sleep here last night?

559
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:28,196
- You're scaring me...
- Answer me!

560
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,980
- Are you serious, Elliot?
- Answer me!

561
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:31,547
- You're hurting me... stop!
- Answer me!

562
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:32,983
Why...
Stop!

563
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:38,119
Stay the fuck away from me,

564
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:40,643
you fucking psycho.

565
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:13,676
So how does it work?

566
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,678
How does what work?

567
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:18,812
If I wanted you
to talk to him.

568
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:21,858
What happened?
Did he come back?

569
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:24,165
I need you to talk to him.

570
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:27,951
Didn't you say that
that could help?

571
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:30,824
Everyone's case is different.

572
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:32,695
But yes,

573
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,785
I think this can help you.

574
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:39,876
What do we do?

575
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,705
Let's just take a moment.

576
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:46,796
Why don't you sit back
and relax?

577
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,108
I'd like you
to close your eyes.

578
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,940
Take a deep breath.

579
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,205
Listen to
the sound of my voice.

580
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:10,080
If you want me to talk to him,

581
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,300
just let him come to me.

582
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:25,661
Give him permission.

583
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,634
Elliot?

584
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:50,033
You should know that
nothing's gonna come from this.

585
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:52,819
We were doing just fine.

586
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,216
It's nice to
finally meet you.

587
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,963
This was better when
I could just come and go

588
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,791
as I pleased,

589
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,793
when we were whole.

590
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:13,927
Now I'm seeing things
that he should be seeing too.

591
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,279
We're just getting torn apart.

592
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:21,978
You need to leave us alone so
I can get him back to our work.

593
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:28,115
Elliot never told me
how attractive you are.

594
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:31,074
You know, for a shrink,
you're, uh, pretty foxy.

595
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:32,815
Thank you, but...

596
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:35,122
I'm more interested
in talking about you.

597
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,037
Come on.
Never thought about it?

598
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,908
Getting with
one of your patients?

599
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:41,302
That would cross
some ethical boundaries for me.

600
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:44,131
Sucks for you.

601
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:47,352
Everybody knows
crazy can be sexy.

602
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:49,179
So you think you're crazy?

603
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:50,485
Relax.

604
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:54,054
It's a figure of speech.

605
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:56,317
Can I ask for your name?

606
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,841
Well, what does he call me?

607
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:01,409
- Mr. Robot.
- Seriously?

608
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,281
He still calls me that?

609
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,326
Talk about labels.

610
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:10,288
I'd like to talk about
why you're here.

611
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:13,334
"A civilization which leaves
so many of its citizens

612
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:16,337
"unsatisfied and
drives them into revolt

613
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:18,121
"neither has nor
deserves the prospect

614
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:20,820
of a lasting existence."

615
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,996
Who said that?

616
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,738
Freud.

617
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:28,349
Wow.
Beautiful and smart.

618
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,310
Sorry.

619
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:35,748
As beautiful as you are,

620
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,490
you're not getting
inside my head.

621
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,143
Why not?

622
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:42,145
Because before
you found out about me,

623
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,843
we were good.

624
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,235
I'm trying to help him.

625
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,889
You're not
trying to help him.

626
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:48,804
You're trying to destroy me.

627
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,937
I'm not trying
to destroy you.

628
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,243
Quite the opposite, actually.

629
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:55,376
I want to understand you.

630
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,814
You understand shit.

631
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:03,297
You're just another phony cooze
playing friend.

632
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,255
Eh, it doesn't matter
anymore anyway.

633
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:07,519
Because of her,
we've been compromised.

634
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:10,435
She compromised us,
and Elliot didn't see it.

635
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:12,393
What do you mean,
you've been compromised?

636
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,419
I'm done talking to you.

637
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:52,302
Krista?

638
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:56,568
When are we gonna start?

639
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:02,574
What happened?
Were you there?

640
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:04,314
Did you go with me
or stay with him?

641
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:06,316
What did you see?

642
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,318
What did Mr. Robot mean,
"We've been compromised"?

643
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:10,364
You were there, you heard it
along with her, right?

644
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,366
What was Mr. Robot
talking about?

645
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,978
Scan my QR code
and I'll suck your dick.

646
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:18,111
Who compromised us?
Who's even us?

647
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:19,982
Him and me?
Or him and Tyrell?

648
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:23,290
No, he couldn't still
be working with Tyrell.

649
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,423
Could he?

650
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:27,381
Is Stage 2 still on?

651
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,557
No, I would know.
That's impossible.

652
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,994
Stage 2 is down.
I made sure of it.

653
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,605
Who compromised me?

654
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:36,129
And why do I suddenly
feel so alive?

655
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:57,585
How do you do it?

656
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:00,458
How do you get so lucky?

657
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,938
Even when the world's
going to shit,

658
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:05,550
you're sitting pretty.

659
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:12,992
The truth is,

660
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:15,690
I never gave a shit
about the dog.

661
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:19,912
In fact, I hate the dog.

662
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:21,479
Vet bills are through the roof

663
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:24,394
because this little
piece of shit is sick.

664
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:27,441
She's been shitting all over
my house for weeks.

665
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,139
It's probably dying.

666
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:33,099
Figured you wanted her
so badly,

667
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:35,536
let her shit
all over your house.

668
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,407
Like you did mine.

669
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,112
Good job.

670
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:38,093
Stage 2.

671
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:42,184
I want it to happen
on the day of the U.N. vote.

672
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,362
Whether it goes our way or not.

673
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:53,369
Sir, Stage 2 is
only meant to be implemented

674
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:56,068
if Price doesn't come through.

675
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:59,724
If the U.N. approves
our annexation of the Congo,

676
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:02,378
we can finally
move our operation

677
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:04,380
to the country's Luwow mine.

678
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:09,081
Why would you still
want to carry this out,

679
00:44:09,124 --> 00:44:12,737
given the serious implications?

680
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:20,570
It's time Phillip Price's
hand got slapped.

681
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:03,613
Last time I buy from
that coffee shop.

682
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:04,876
They only take Ecoin.

683
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:06,704
Gotta use Ecoin.

684
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:08,836
With the exchange rate,
dollar's worth shit now.

685
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:15,887
You get anything
from Elliot's computer?

686
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,758
He hasn't logged in all day.

687
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:20,761
Last night he sent
an encrypted email with a link.

688
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:24,286
Could be lucky,

689
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,506
could be sending it
to Tyrell, right?

690
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:28,203
Is this from last night?

691
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:31,729
Oh, also I was able to get

692
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:34,166
a clean audio recording
of his place.

693
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:35,515
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

694
00:45:35,558 --> 00:45:36,777
He dropped some good intel.

695
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:39,345
Here, let me play it for you.

696
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:44,176
Ugh.

697
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:46,178
That'll be stuck in my head
all day now.

698
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:52,488
Turn it off.

699
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,577
Is that coming from downstairs?

700
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:57,885
Yeah, that's
Darlene's apartment, but...

701
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,452
who the fuck is that?

702
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:01,410
- Is Darlene home?
- No, she's out.

703
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:04,936
You think she told someone
about the safe house?

704
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:10,985
This email he sent
from his computer,

705
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:12,682
did you go to this link?

706
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:14,815
Yeah, downloaded the file,
opened it,

707
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:17,513
