# Race conditions, like any other failures are pesky things designed to torture you in professional life alluding you
# towards alcohol, smoking, drugs and the other vices. However, we don't have to go that far. Programming languages
# offer simple constructs like synchronization to prevent you from doing substance abuse. Ofcourse, I am preaching
# to the choir ... so let's dive into code and see how python does these things in action.

# For our simplistic toy example (and really, that's the limit of my technical super-strength here), we are going to
# have 2 different..no... 3 different emitters A.K.A producers for the techies! :( emitting 3 different quotes and
# 3 consumers writing them into a text file. Like a sadist, we will watch them all getting jumbled up and laugh
# out loud (like The Devil/Satan/Iblis/Yamraaj/Lucifer ... ooh! that's cool series on Netflix! Have you seen it?)
# And about that laughter, really?? Why does the evil have to laugh out loud? I don't get it. You designed it that way
# and it worked... so? what's the big story here? I mean programmers do this all the damn time! You don't see me
# laughing after this program working the way I wanted it work, do you? Such a clichÃ© I tell you!
