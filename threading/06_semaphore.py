# So using a condition variable allows us to synchronize between two threads. But what if you had to synchronize
# across multiple threads? Like how would you allow a "controlled access" to a certain number of threads? Any
# guesses? Well a semaphore comes to the rescue. Apparently, semaphore was invented by a Dutch computer scientist -
# Edseger Dijkstra :( Not only his inventions are pain, but so is his name! I believe keeping English as the world's
# communication language for a foreseeable future all the languages of the world including mine really ought to
# "normalize" the names that are easily pronounceable. I mean c'mmon... Edseger Dijkstra? As an Indian myself,
# I pronounced his name as the syllables were introduced to me in kindergarten - "Ed-say-ger dee-juk-stra". I know I
# inserted the 'u' there, but I couldn't really pronounce jk together without making an "u" sound (u as in under). I
# know ... lame! :( Anyways, my way of pronunciation of that name doesn't have a nice ring to it. So I googled :| It
# turns out, the name is pronounced "ets-kar daa-eek-stra" with a very rounded D and T sounds (not sharp as in "dot"
# in english) :| Now, why does there have to be a j in his first name? :| Well, only the "dutchman" knows,
# but the point is Mr. Dijkstra being genius and all managed to get us into trouble by investing his time into
# algorithms. This is a classic case of someone enjoying the cake and someone else footing the bill :( ... Anyways,
# Dijkstra's famous "Shortest Path Algorithm" is well known in the field of Computer Science. When I say "well
# known", I mean it is known to a lot many people, EXCEPT ME! :| Now, depending on your career aspirations or your
# desire to socialize with the "tech gurus" within the company, you might choose to know/study it. For the rest of
# lesser mortals like me, as long as the "GPS lady" correctly guides us from Sodawala Lane (Borivali) to Zhaveri
# Baazar (Kalbadevi), we are sorted ;)
#
# I have digressed... as I usually do :|. So, coming back, semaphore is a fancy word for "flag". This flag is
# basically a signal used for communicating with another thread. Ever seen railway folks wave a physical flag to an
# incoming/ outgoing trains? THAT! my friend is a real life semaphore. In the software universe, a semaphore will
# allow communication between specific # of threads and enable concurrency. You could achieve the same goal with
# locks and a counter, but why re-invent the wheel? Typically, you initialize a Semaphore by a count and then keep on
# "acquiring it". After a certain point the acquire call will block preventing access to the method/critical section
# thereby providing concurrency/synchronization as desired.
#
# Let's try to understand this by simulating a "parking lot problem" that we experience in everyday life. A very
# standard interview question ;). So we know there are specific # of slots in a parking lot. Any additional cars
# that come in will have to wait till somebody clears off their slot. That's what we will attempt to build using
# semaphores. Let's get into it.

# We define the number of slots that are available in our parking lot. I'm being stingy here only for the purposes of
# demonstration. An actual lot could have a lot more (pun not intended!) but a small mind and smaller heart can't
# conjure up a big number as you can imagine :|
AVAILABLE_SLOTS = 5

# This the timeout value that each thread will use to wait on the acquire() method of the semaphore.
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 5
